# Python-General
General Python scripts that do not fit within another project. See [ArcGIS-util](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/ArcGIS-util) for scripts related to ESRI products.

Not all of the scripts here were originally created by me. Original creators are credited within `.py` files or in `README` files when applicable.
