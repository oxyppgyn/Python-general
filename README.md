# Python-General
General Python scripts that do not fit within another project. See [ArcGIS-util](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/ArcGIS-util) for scripts related to ESRI products.

Not all of the scripts here were originally created by me. Original creators are credited within `.py` files or in `README` files when applicable. 


## List of Scripts:
### tkinter
- `fontList` (via [jimmiesrustled](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39614027/list-available-font-families-in-tkinter)) - Outputs all font types available by default in tkinter. Clicking on a font copies it to the clipboard for easy pasting to a script.

### misc
- `hashDirectoryFiles` - Create hashes for all files in a folder and output to a `.txt` file. Useful for finding duplicate files in one or more folders.
- `renameFileToDate` - Rename files in a folder to the date shown in file explorer (date format: YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS).
